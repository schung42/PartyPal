# PartyPal
Be The Best Host You Can Be

This is my CS242 Final Project that optimizes the Party Hosting experience. 

My roommates and I have always been caught in the conundrum when hosting a party of either:
  1. Buying way too many refreshments 
  2. Not buying enough, running out and being embarrased

PartyPal includes everything a person needs to host a party:
  1. Refreshment Calculator
  2. Music Player (No More fumbling with music)
  3. BAC Calculator (No DUI's for you)
  4. Google Maps (To get those drunken degenerates home)

Music Player credit go to Nikita Vasilyev. The music player in PartyPal is a modified version.
